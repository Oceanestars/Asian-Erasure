# Asian Erasure

[![Pull Requests Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

Asian Erasure is a passion project that was birthed from 3 students in a data visualization class who wanted to use data to help the AAPI community. This website combines data on AAPI individuals in the movie industry as well as movies who have had a negative impact on the community.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
